<p>This extension improves the existing CollaboratorEverywhere by James Kettle.</p>
<p>It augments your in-scope proxy traffic by injecting non-invasive headers designed to reveal backend systems by causing pingbacks to Burp Collaborator.</p>
<p>To use it, simply install it and browse the target website. Findings will be presented in the 'Issues' view, as well as in an additional tab.</p>
<p>Payloads can easily be modified, enabled or disabled.</p>
